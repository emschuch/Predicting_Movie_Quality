# Predicting Movie Quality

This was my second project for the Metis data science bootcamp.

For this project, I created a webscraper which uses the Python package, BeautifulSoup, to scrape data for 15 years worth of films from IMDB. I then explored predicting quality of films with linear regression. I created different models to predict IMDB user ratings and Metacritic score as my measures of quality.

You can read more about the web-scraping portion of this project on my blog [here](http://emschuch.github.io/Web-Scraping/).
